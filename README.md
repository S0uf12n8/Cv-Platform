# CV Platform

**Structured CV Creation, Enhancement & Job Matching System**

---

## 📌 Description

CV Platform is a career-oriented web application that helps users create, enhance, and manage their CVs while enabling structured job matching and application tracking.

The core idea of this project is to treat a CV as **structured data**, not just a static document.  
This allows the system to validate, improve, score, and match CVs programmatically.

The project is developed as a multi-month **academic team project**, with a strong focus on **C++**, **data structures**, **databases**, and **software architecture**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Model a CV using object-oriented programming
- Apply data structures to manage skills and experiences
- Store CVs and job data in a relational database
- Generate PDF CVs from structured data
- Enhance CV content using rule-based logic
- Match CVs with relevant job offers from a controlled dataset
- Track job applications
- Practice team-based software development

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

Unlike simple CV builders, this project is centered around a **C++ core engine** that:

- Represents CVs as structured objects
- Validates and normalizes user data
- Applies scoring and matching logic
- Produces outputs (PDF, matching results) algorithmically

The frontend and database layers exist to **support the core logic**, not replace it.

## 🔍 Features

### Current / Planned

- Create a CV from scratch
- Upload an existing CV for enhancement
- Generate CV as PDF
- Validate and normalize CV content
- Enhance “About Me” and skills sections
- Match CVs to relevant jobs
